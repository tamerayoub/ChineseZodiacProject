There's 12 Chinese Zodiac animales used to represent years and 2020 is the year of the rat. Zodiac plays a big part in 
Chinese culture and its used tp determine your fortune, marriage compatability, career fit and even the best time to have a baby.
Chinese Zodiac originally had something to do with the worship of animals. This zodiac system has been around for more than 2000 years.

Each animal has its own meaning and characteristics. The animals listed in order is the rat, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, 
and pig. The zodiac cycle repeats every 12 years. For example; a rats description is that they like to steal food alot which means their household is very wealthy. 
Because of their fast reproduction rate, some also pray on its children.

I was born in the year 1998 which makes me a Tiger. Tiger's are independent and have high self-esteems. They enjoy being the leader and protector of average people.
They love justice and never back down in an argument. Recklessness is their biggest weakness causing them to fail. However they never truly fail. Tigers will always find a way
to stand back up and succeed in the end. Western Zodiac, unlike Chinese use astrology. Same concept but different meanings.
